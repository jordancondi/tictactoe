# usage
this branch is empty. There are three major branches which are stable and reference:

main-unity
main-unreal
main-bevy

they'll have our voxel example projects. (right now, only the bevy and unity branches are pulled from the good examples done by community) if you find something that can be improved, please send a pull request to those branches. Those projects will be helpful for beginner game developers so you'll be blessed by the angles of programming. Thanks!
