Removed Start method in FinecraftGod.cs
Reduced lines of code Vector3 universeSize instead of universeSizeX, Y, Z
Added totalVoxelCount
Changed if statement for checking totalVoxelCount exceeding maxVoxelCount (there's no case it can exceed, only be the same)
Refactored universeSize to Vector3 and changed universeSizeX, Y, Z accordingly (rounding the float amounts to an int)
Removed switch and used Initialize method instead (with typeRandom and amountRandom parameters)
Shortened Voxel class for properties and member variables
Moved the count for each Voxel in the Voxel class and added the switch for counting each Voxel in the Initialize method
Changed the Cube (prefab) dimensions from 0.2 to 1
